## The Problem

Home- and solo-stakers are the backbone of the Ethereum network and are responsible for supporting its core values like decentralization and censorship-resistance. However, liquid staking and restaking protocols and their associated liquid tokens benefit from economies of scale in ways that home-stakers cannot compete. These often-centralized, well-capitalized protocols have abundant resources to advocate for themselves whereas solo stakers are by definition, decentralized, disorganized, and difficult to identify. Maximizing the consideration of home-stakers in protocol design and external rewards flow is key to ensuring the network retains its existing home-stakers and attracts new ones to maintain Ethereum's core values.

## Objectives

1. Support the Ethereum network by maintaining the decentralization of validators
2. Build and maintain a comprehensive and reliable list of home-stakers interested in participation
3. Establish connections with ecosystem participants who are interested in supporting this public good
4. Secure stable, long-term incentives to encourage home-staking
