### Plan
 
- Grants: identify "white space" products or documentation that would encourage more people to become solo stakers. Identify potential people who could deliver these solutions cost effectively through their participation in other communities such as EthStaker and encourage them to apply for targeted grants from Staker's Union. Recruit partners to act as grant "multipliers" - e.g., Eth foundation, Gitcoin grants - target bringing in 3 partner dollars for each grant dollar from Staker's Union.
