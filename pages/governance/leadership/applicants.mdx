## dr.dormouse (Marketing)
### Experience and Qualifications
I spent nine years working for a boutique investment bank with the sole focus of helping alternative asset managers raise institution capital for their private equity funds.  My role was multifaceted and included consulting on marketing strategy and materials, managing our institutional sales team which covered over 1000 institutions in the United States and Canda, and selectively calling on and meeting with key institutional investors.

Most recently, after the bankruptcies of many prominent crypto brokerages I found myself involved in leadership positions of an Ad Hoc group and a preference defense group as a creditor and committee member.  I am uniquely passionate about the importance of decentralization and can speak personally about the costs and risk of centralization.  

Additionally, I have been a solo Staker since Genesis block and active member of the Ethereum community since 2018. 
 
### Vision
To position the Stakers Union as the predominant platform representing solo & home stakers and achieving such reputation through impactful and well-intentioned action.  
Today, the supermajority of staking is done with centralized third parties including liquid staking derivatives, centralized financial institutions or staking pools. Only a small fraction of staking is decentralized and done by home and solo stakers.  It is undisputed that this low level of decentralization is not ideal.  Instead it is a threat to the security of the Ethereum network. Due to this dynamic, capital put towards incentivizing solo and home staking will provide a multiple of return to the value of Ethereum.  The Stakers Union is here to bring awareness to this opportunity, raise capital to incentivize solo and home staking, and improve the decentralization of the security infrastructure of the Ethereum network.  The value of Ethereum is not zero sum and as a community we are underinvesting in solo and home staking and decentralization. 

### Plan
I will implement a three-part marketing strategy aimed at each of our major stakeholders:

#### Part 1 – Partners

Partners will need to be researched and thoughtfully approached.  We have the benefit of being an organization that is addressing a real need.  Our success will benefit all Ethereum community members including centralized staking solutions.  However, the list of potential partners is not endless and a copy and paste outreach campaign will do more harm than good.  

#### Part 2 – Solo stakers (Stakers Union verified members and non-members)

Creating appealing content for solo stakers will be a focus of the marketing subcommittee. Providing value via social media publications and community engagement is arguably the best organic way to draw attention to the Stakers Union. 
In order to be responsive and promote community engagement, the marketing subcommittee will be actively posting content for potential and existing members on Discord (official Stakers Union Discord), post updates via X (@stakersunion), create a FAQ section for interested individuals and monitoring email exchanges and inquiries.

The marketing subcommittee in conjunction with the technical subcommittee will design member specific benefits as shown below:
Verified Member Benefits 
1)	Incentives distributed to verified Solo/Home stakers
2)	Ensure your deposit/withdrawal address is on the Stakers Union Solo/Home Staker registry
3)	Access to members only chat
4)	Early access to testing Stakers Union improvements 
5)	Access to discounts or free tickets for Ethereum related events
6)	Exclusive POAP for verified members
Non member
1)	Educational content on “how to launch your solo staking node”
2)	Access to general chat 
3)	Mint Free POAP to support Stakers Union
 
#### Part 3 – The broader Ethereum ecosystem

Increasing the general awareness of the Stakers Union is the first step in building reputation.  Our current website has been pivotal.  We should have a complete set of materials including a pitch deck and talking points that can be referenced across social media posts, calls and presentations.  

One of my first actions will be to appoint social media manager.  I am not experienced in creating graphics or running social media campaigns.  The Stakers Union should develop a social media content calendar with regular posts that support general awareness of the Stakers Union and our objectives. 

A second priority will be to coordinate our outreach efforts within the Stakers Union.  We have already seen an example of multiple reach outs to the same community member who was already in active dialogue with our group.  This can hurt our efforts.  

#### Engage with the Ethereum and solo staking communities on various social media platforms. 
I plan to actively monitor and engage on the following platforms: X, Discord, Reddit

The communities I intend to connect with (but not limited to) are:
- r/ethstaker (reddit)
- r/ethereum (reddit)
- Bankless Nation (discord)
- Ethereum org (discord)
- @ethstaker (X)

As it relates to social media accounts, I propose we are clear on which accounts are either owned by @thame, the marketing leader (when elected), or shared. In addition the marketing lead would need an email address Marketing@StakersUnion.com

- Create Unique Partnership proposals applicable to prospective partners. 
	Teams like Puffer Finance (Restaking), Eigen Layer (Restaking), Kelp DAO (Restaking), LIDO (LSD) and Base Chain (ETH L2) are top on our radar for potential partnerships. The marketing subcommittee will ensure that a tailored proposal is presented and value is provided to our partners. 
- Reach out to potential partners and track response status. 
	Having a detailed and updated tracking system for partnership relationships is critical. I have experience in managing and using such a system in Salesforce.  Day 1 changes I’d like to implement to our partnership tracker including:
- Adding ownership for each relationship
- Adding stages such as interested, declined, due diligence, soft circle, hard circle etc..
- Adding next steps

I would ask for ownership of such a tracking tool and plan to follow up with the owners of each relationship regularly.  My role would be to do a material amount of direct reach out and support others in the group.  My support would range from simply providing guidance or materials to leading calls setup by other members.

#### Expand and promote the Stakers Union pledge
The Staker Union pledge should reflect the core of what we represent.  The marketing subcommittee should keep it central to all materials and messaging.  If there is any need to make improvements to the pledge, I will raise the need to the larger group. 

### Additional Tasks
- Have a database with brand assets
- Coordinate with the technical subcommittee to create a dedicated dashboard that can be used for publications and sharing with community members. 
- Have a database of publications and an ongoing process for content creation ideas.
- Work with Chairperson to draft general updates from them that can provide an accessible way to digest the progress of the Stakers Union
- Follow up on ongoing communications with David Hoffman
