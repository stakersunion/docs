## @PabloMunoz_csc for [Marketing Subcommittee](/governance/subcommittees#-marketing) Leader

### Experience and Qualifications

- With over six years of experience in website management, video editing, graphic design, and copywriting, I’ve worked with a diverse range of clients and projects. These include local government agencies, YouTube channels, ecommerce stores, and other initiatives requiring content creation and compelling copy.  
- In addition to my creative expertise, I’ve been engaged in the crypto space for the past four years, with a particular focus on the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Vision
- My vision for the Stakers Union is to establish it as the premier community for solo-stakers, recognized for its role in Ethereum’s security infrastructure. I aim to raise awareness about the critical importance of solo-stakers while creating content that not only highlights the Stakers Union but also educates and adds value to the Ethereum community.  
- In today’s attention-driven economy, social media and content creation play a crucial role in shaping a community’s reputation, perception, and credibility. The Stakers Union’s content must reflect its core values and ideas while being presented in an engaging, accessible, and fun format to keep our audience invested and informed.

### Plan
As the leader of the marketing subcommittee, I will focus on three key areas to effectively engage our target audience and the Ethereum community:

1. **Educational Content:** To position the Stakers Union as a reputable and valuable resource, I’ll prioritize creating and distributing educational materials. These will take the form of blog posts, Twitter threads, and other formats that simplify complex topics and provide actionable insights for the community.

2. **Community Consensus and Public Statements:** A unified voice is essential for building credibility. I’ll work to gather input from Stakers Union members, facilitate discussions, and help the community reach consensus on key issues. These collective opinions will be shared as official public statements, amplifying our presence and influence within the Ethereum ecosystem.

3. **Partnership Development:** The recent airdrop allocation to the Stakers Union, supported by Obol—a team with roots in the Ethereum Foundation—has already elevated our community’s legitimacy. As marketing leader, I’ll actively seek out and engage with potential partners who see value in collaborating with the Stakers Union, just as Obol has.

### Additional Tasks

To ensure consistent progress and engagement, I’ll focus on the following tasks:

1. Weekly Social Media Engagement: Design and post one tweet per week covering topics relevant to ETH staking.
2. Monthly Blog Posts: Publish one blog post each month covering key issues such as EIPs, staking centralization, client diversity, and other topics in the ETH staking space.
3. Community Collaboration: Engage with verified members to facilitate discussions, reach consensus, and issue public statements via X.
4. Educational Material Development: Collaborate with the Technical Subcommittee to create tutorials and guides for Stakers Union members, as well as content for public distribution via X or blog posts.
