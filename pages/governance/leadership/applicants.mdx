### Expansion of the PoS Community for Stakers Union During Key Events in 2024

#### Summary
My proposal is to leverage my participation in DEVCON VII, ETHGlobal Bangkok, and the Staking Summit 2024 to expand the Stakers Union community. Additionally, I will continue the efforts made in Mexico, where events such as ETHMexico and ETHVeracruz were held to introduce the community. The plan includes organizing in-person meetups, promoting the community, and forging strategic collaborations with leaders in the Ethereum and Proof of Stake (PoS) ecosystem, with the goal of increasing membership and strengthening our international network, with an emphasis on the Latin American region.

#### Rationale
Since my participation in Ethereum Mexico 2024 events, I have had the opportunity to present Stakers Union in various forums, generating interest in the local community. However, there is a significant opportunity to solidify our international presence by taking advantage of my attendance at high-level events such as DEVCON VII, ETHGlobal Bangkok, and the Staking Summit 2024. These events provide invaluable platforms to connect with industry pioneers and attract new members, especially in emerging markets where Proof of Stake is gaining relevance.

#### Specifications
* Meetup Organization:
    * During the events, I will organize networking sessions and informal meetups to introduce Stakers Union.
    * I will present informational material and discuss the benefits of joining the community.
* Community Promotion:
    * I will continue the work done in Mexico, where I presented the community during events like Ethereum Mexico 2024 and other local gatherings, promoting active participation and the benefits of being part of Stakers Union.
* Strategic Collaborations:
    * I will facilitate meetings with leaders and relevant projects in the PoS space, seeking strategic alliances that will benefit our community.
    * I will propose the creation of collaboration programs to strengthen Stakers Union initiatives.

#### Implementation
* During the Events (November 2024):
    * I will organize and participate in networking sessions and meetups with potential new members and allies.
    * I will present Stakers Union in relevant forums, promoting the expansion of our community.
* Post-Events (December 2024):
* I will draft a detailed report on collaboration opportunities and connections made during the events.
* I will work with the Community Subcommittee to implement expansion strategies and follow-up on new relationships.

#### Outcomes
* International Community Growth: The global membership of Stakers Union will increase, particularly in regions like Latin America and Asia, thanks to direct promotion at international events.
* New Strategic Collaborations: Relationships with key players in the PoS industry will be established, opening possibilities for new initiatives and collaborative projects.
* Increased Visibility: We will strengthen Stakers Union's presence as a key player in discussions on the future of Proof of Stake and its global impact.
