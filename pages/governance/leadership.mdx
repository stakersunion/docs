Each [subcommittee](/governance/subcommittees) will launch after a subcommittee lead is appointed. The subcommittee lead is responsible for the identification and completion of tasks related to their area of responsibility as well as the development or expansion of related documentation. Subcommittee leads may in turn nominate additional subcommittee participants to assist with the completion of subcommittee tasks.

## Chairperson

In addition to Subcommittee leaders, the Stakers Union will have a Chairperson who will be responsible for the overall coordination of the different subcommittees. The Chairperson will coordinate quarterly planning meetings and monthly progress check-ins with the subcommittee leads to review progress and discuss future plans. The Chairperson will also be responsible for subcommittee tasks where no lead has been appointed.

## Tasks

In addition to the tasks outlined in the [subcommittee descriptions](/governance/subcommittees), leaders must participate in a multi-signature contract managing the Stakers Union treasury and other assets (ex. ENS domain). Leaders must use appropriate security measures for their selected address including the use of a hardware wallet.
