# How to Vote

Head to the Stakers Union [Snapshot Space](https://vote.stakersunion.com/) to view and vote on proposals. To be eligible to vote, your voting power must be at least 1 "UNION".

## Voting Power

You must sign in to the Snapshot Space using the wallet that holds your Verified Member POAP (which provides your voting power). If you're unsure of the wallet used to claim your POAP, find the email containing your mint link sent to the address associated with your account.
