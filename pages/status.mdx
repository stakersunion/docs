### December 2024

#### [2025 Roadmap](/roadmap)
The Stakers Union has made significant progress in 2024, including successful X/Twitter threads and the first in-person meetup at Devcon, with membership now at 132 verified members. For 2025, the Stakers Union aims to clarify its mission, which focuses on supporting solo-stakers within Ethereum to maintain decentralization and network security, while seeking out-of-protocol incentives and actively participating in protocol development. Membership requirements are under review, particularly regarding bond amounts and DVT verification. Key objectives for the year include expanding membership, securing partnerships for rewards, integrating Gitcoin Passport to combat Sybil attacks, and applying for public goods funding. The Union will continue its advocacy for solo-stakers and work towards increasing engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### EIP-7732 Advocacy

The Stakers Union proposed a [governance vote](https://vote.stakersunion.com/#/proposal/0xbfc9afd15e1ef76baad4fae5f0a051f8adbc620e8251affabd8d6fb26bc2480a) to express formal support for EIP-7732 and it's inclusion in Fusaka. A quorum was not reached however participating votes were unanimously in favor of the EIP.

### November 2024

#### Membership

The current [verification](/membership/verification) process is challenging for participants running distributed validators. Further discussion is required to determine whether and how to verify these participants. Difficulties verifying DV participants has prompted a broader discussion on membership requirements including a possible bond minimum.

### September 2024

#### Governance

The Stakers Union [Governance Proposal](/governance) was approved by a [member vote](https://vote.stakersunion.com/#/proposal/0x15edb104f146af65ae66e3a4a028942b0f1140ed0ed474647dffa67ab7e6159b). The proposal outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Stakers Union governance and we are currently accepting applications for [leadership positions](/governance/leadership). Suggestions for modifications include:

- Considering revision of the [term](/governance/leadership#term) duration (3 months) as this may be too short. Options include increasing the term or maintaining the 3-month term for a probationary period (ex. 6 months) before extending the term for successful leaders.
