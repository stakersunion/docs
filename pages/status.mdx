## Status

Areas of active development and discussion are included here.

### Governance
The Stakers Union [Governance Proposal](/governance) was approved by a [member vote](https://vote.stakersunion.com/#/proposal/0x15edb104f146af65ae66e3a4a028942b0f1140ed0ed474647dffa67ab7e6159b). The proposal outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Stakers Union governance and we are currently accepting applications for [leadership positions](/governance/leadership). Suggestions for modifications include:
- Considering revision of the [term](/governance/leadership#term) duration (3 months) as this may be too short. Options include increasing the term or maintaining the 3-month term for a probationary period (ex. 6 months) before extending the term for successful leaders.

### Membership
The current [verification](/membership/verification) process is challenging for participants running distributed validators. Further discussion is required to determine whether and how to verify these participants.
