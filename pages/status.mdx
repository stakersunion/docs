Areas of active development and discussion are included here.

### July 2025

The Stakers Union achieved a significant milestone with our community's first distributed incentives. The [Obol Collective](https://obol.org/) dropped 25,000 $OBOL to the Stakers Union [Mainnet Splits](https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x0974BCD54Cfe0370D06F358E6DF41eBf464455Ff/?chainId=1) contract which was subsequently distributed to our verified members.

In addition, Stakers Union members voted to <SnapshotLink href={'/proposal/0x12c2cab2e2e2c6e5343056e41eb4c674465829a04f94450170784f16c11962d5'}>add delegation</SnapshotLink> - potentially allowing for more productive governance while continuing to represent the majority opinion of participating members.

### February 2025

A proposal allowing a ["Transfer of Watch"](https://github.com/stakersunion/docs/tree/transfer) was submitted for a vote. The proposal suggested a method to allow currently-verified members to transfer their eligibility to another address (circumventing the need to re-verify or undergo an appeal if their new address was not on the existing StakeCat List). The <SnapshotLink href={'/proposal/0x45bbcac34dd8e32080815692720ba28bf1651aa7f846c280446197a0a68d8c93'}>proposal</SnapshotLink> failed due to an inability to reach a quorum despite the vast majority of votes being in favor (28-1). This suggested a need to reconsider the voting process and quorum requirements for future proposals to avoid stagnation related to limited governance participation.

### December 2024

#### [2025 Roadmap](/roadmap)

The Stakers Union has made significant progress in 2024, including successful X/Twitter threads and the first in-person meetup at Devcon, with membership now at 132 verified members. For 2025, the Stakers Union aims to clarify its mission, which focuses on supporting solo-stakers within Ethereum to maintain decentralization and network security, while seeking out-of-protocol incentives and actively participating in protocol development. Membership requirements are under review, particularly regarding bond amounts and DVT verification. Key objectives for the year include expanding membership, securing partnerships for rewards, integrating Gitcoin Passport to combat Sybil attacks, and applying for public goods funding. The Union will continue its advocacy for solo-stakers and work towards increasing engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### EIP-7732 Advocacy

The Stakers Union proposed a <SnapshotLink href={'/proposal/0xbfc9afd15e1ef76baad4fae5f0a051f8adbc620e8251affabd8d6fb26bc2480a'}>governance vote</SnapshotLink> to express formal support for EIP-7732 and it's inclusion in Fusaka. A quorum was not reached however participating votes were unanimously in favor of the EIP.

### November 2024

#### Membership

The current [verification](/membership/verification) process is challenging for participants running distributed validators. Further discussion is required to determine whether and how to verify these participants. Difficulties verifying DV participants has prompted a broader discussion on membership requirements including a possible bond minimum.

### September 2024

#### Governance

The Stakers Union [Governance Proposal](/governance) was approved by a <SnapshotLink href={'/proposal/0x15edb104f146af65ae66e3a4a028942b0f1140ed0ed474647dffa67ab7e6159b'}>member vote</SnapshotLink>. The proposal outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Stakers Union governance and we are currently accepting applications for [leadership positions](/governance/leadership). Suggestions for modifications include:

- Considering revision of the [term](/governance/leadership#term) duration (3 months) as this may be too short. Options include increasing the term or maintaining the 3-month term for a probationary period (ex. 6 months) before extending the term for successful leaders.
