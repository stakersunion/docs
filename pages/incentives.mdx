# Incentives

The Stakers Union hopes to continue to encourage ecosystem participants to continue to allocate airdrops to home-stakers to support the decentralization of the Ethereum network. However, the Stakers Union is primarily interested in securing sustainable, long-term support for home-stakers through recurring ecosystem grants and funding opportunities.
