# Privacy

The Stakers Union takes member privacy seriously and is committed to avoiding the collection of any personal data.

## Authentication
While your Stakers Union profile requires authentication with an Ethereum wallet, members are encouraged to use a separate wallet for this purpose. This wallet should not be used for any other purpose, and should not be linked to any other personal information.


## Profile
Your Stakers Union profile requires some details like a display name, email address and Discord handle. These details are needed to communicate critical updates with members and support participation in our community. However, you should use a pseudonym, an anonymous/forwarding email address and a Discord handle that does not reveal your identity.

## Proof of Residential Operation
The Stakers Union application includes an option to submit a photo of your node for [Proof of Residential Operation](/membership/verification#proof-of-residential-operation). The Stakers Union website strips metadata from the photo before uploading for review but you may choose to do this yourself before submitting.
