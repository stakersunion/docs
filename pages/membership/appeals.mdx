# Appeal Process

While the StakeCat lists ([List A](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers/blob/main/Solo-Stakers/Solo-Stakers-A.csv) or [RocketPool](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers/blob/main/Solo-Stakers/Rocketpool-Solo-Stakers.csv)) used for automatic eligibility verification are comprehensive and updated regularly, no list is perfect. The Stakers Union provides an appeals process for consideration of addresses which are not automatically verified.

If your address is not automatically verified, you will be directed to an appeals application with the following requirements:

1. Contact email address for updates (should be monitored but anonymous)
2. ETH address you are appealing
3. Address type (Deposit, Withdrawal, or Fee Recipient)
4. Staking method
5. Your rationale including any information related to your staking history and setup that you think would be helpful.

The Stakers Union submits appeal applications on a rolling basis to verified members in the ðŸ”’ | members-only channel for a vote over 7 days and are decided by a simple majority. Notification of the outcome will be sent to the email address provided.

Successful appeals become full Stakers Union members and are proposed for inclusion to StakeCat in future list updates.
