# Appeal Process

If the address you sign with is not included on [StakeCat List A](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers/blob/main/Solo-Stakers/Solo-Stakers-A.csv) or [StakeCat RocketPool List](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers/blob/main/Solo-Stakers/Rocketpool-Solo-Stakers.csv) your signature will not be automatically verified. You can submit an appeal on the form linked in the application process which must include:

1. Contact email address for updates
2. ETH address you are appealing
3. Address type (Deposit, Withdrawal, or Fee Recipient)
4. Staking method
5. Your rationale including any information related to your staking history and setup that you think would be helpful.

The Stakers Union submits appeal applications on a rolling basis to verified members for a vote. Notification of the outcome will be sent to the email address provided.
