# Transfer

It is the member's responsibility to ensure that their associated validators remain active. For various reasons, a member may elect to exit and deposit from a different address. If there are no remaining active validators associated with a member, the member will be removed from the membership list and will need to reapply (including completing the [appeals](/membership/appeals) process if their new address is not eligible).

For existing verified members only, there is an option to transfer Proof of Eligibility to a new address. This process is known as a "Transfer of Watch".

## Transfer of Watch

To avoid the [appeals](/membership/appeals) process, the member may request a "Transfer of Watch" by submitting verified signatures from the old and new addresses.

### Relinquishing the Watch (Signed by the Original Address)

```text copy
Night sighs, and my watch draws to a close.
I, [OLD_ADDRESS], do surrender my station:
No longer shall I stand guard at this node.
I renounce the mantle of vigilance and pass it on,
that others may keep the fire burning against the dark.

I pledge that I have acted in good faith and with open code,
and now I entrust this solemn watch to [NEW_ADDRESS].

Thus ends my watchâ€”yet my commitment to the network endures.
May the chain remain unbroken, may corruption be held at bay.
My final signature stands in testament: I was, once, a watcher.
```

### Accepting the Watch (Signed by the New Address)

```text copy
Night gathers, and now my stake begins.
I, [NEW_ADDRESS], do assume the mantle from [OLD_ADDRESS]:
From this moment forth, I am the sentinel at this node.
Where the old watch has stood firm, I now take my place,
vowing to guard the ledger and its truth with unwavering resolve.
```
