# Verification

The Stakers Union employs a comprehensive verification process to ensure the integrity of its membership lists. The process includes several steps detailed below:

<Steps>

### Proof of Eligibility

Submission of a signed oath from an eligible validator deposit or withdrawal address. The address must be present on [StakeCat List A](https://github.com/Stake-Cat/Solo-Stakers/blob/main/Solo-Stakers/Solo-Stakers-A.csv) or an accepted [appeal](/membership/appeals). Instructions for signing messages are available [here](/membership/verification/signing).

#### Oath

```text copy
Night gathers, and now my stake begins.
It shall not end until my final block.
I shall hold no memes, bear no greed and claim no fame.
I shall live and die at my node.
I am the validator in the shadows.
I am the watcher on the chains.
I am the shield that guards against corruption, the fire that fuels the network, the light that maintains transparency, the horn that calls to the honest.
I pledge my code and commitment to Ethereum, for this epoch and all the epochs to come.
```

### Proof of Independent Operation

After approval of their signed message, prospective members will be able to select one of two methods for proving independent operation of their validator.

#### Disable attestations
The preferred option is to select a date and time from a range of random options over a 1-week period. The prospective member must briefly disable attestations on at least one associated validator - this action proves the validator is under the control of the prospective member.

##### Requirements

1. Disable attestations beginning in the epoch following the selected date/time
1. Minimum of two consecutive missed attestations and no more than ten consecutive missed attestations on at least one validator
1. Only one repeat attempt is allowed if the first attempt fails

##### Recommendations

Consider using a service like [wenmerge](https://wenmerge.com/block-proposer-schedule/validator-proposal-subscription/) to avoid selecting a time when your validator is scheduled for high-priority tasks (block proposal, sync committee duty).

#### Block Graffiti
An alternative approach for prospective members who are unwilling to disable attestations is to include a shortened version of the Stakers Union oath in the graffiti field of a proposed block.

##### Requirements
1. The shortened oath must be included in the graffiti field of a block: `Night gathers, my stake begins.`
1. The block height of an eligible block must be submitted in the Stakers Union application.

### Proof of Residential Operation

An optional step to prove residential operation and access to additional multipliers. Prospective members must submit a photo of their node with the following requirements:

1. Photo must be taken on the same day as Proof of Independent Operation
1. The hardware should be clearly visible.
1. An international newspaper front page or a printout of the front page of a major news website must be included, with the text "Stakers Union" hand-written visibly on it.

#### Example
