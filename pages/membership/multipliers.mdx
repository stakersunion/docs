# Multipliers

The Stakers Union prioritizes independent/decentralized node operation, performance and commitment to the Ethereum network. These values are reflected in multipliers that determine the distribution of incentives.

## Independent Node Operation

| Location | Multiplier |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Home     | 1          |
| Remote   | 0.75       |

## Performance

| Metric[^1]                                                    | Multiplier |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Block Proposals**                                           |            |
| Percent Block Proposals &gt;95%<br /> (or zero scheduled)     | 1          |
| Percent Block Proposals 51-94%                                | 0.75       |
| Percent Block Proposals &lt;50%                               | 0.5        |
| **Attestations**                                              |            |
| Percent Attestations &gt;95%                                  | 1          |
| Percent Attestations 90-94%                                   | 0.75       |
| Percent Attestations &lt;89%                                  | 0.5        |
| **Sync Participation**                                        |            |
| Percent Sync Participation &gt;95% <br /> (or zero scheduled) | 1          |
| Percent Sync Participation 90-94%                             | 0.75       |
| Percent Sync Participation &lt;89%                            | 0.5        |

## Commitment

### Entry

| Stage[^2]                                             | Multiplier |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Genesis <br /> <small>(deposit before launch)</small> | 1.5        |
| Pre-Merge                                             | 1.25       |
| Post-Merge                                            | 1          |

### Other

| Activity                                                     | Multiplier |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [KZG Ceremony Participation](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/) | 1.125      |

## Multiplier Calculation

```text
Final Multiplier = Independent Node Operation Multiplier * Average Performance Multiplier * Commitment Multiplier
```

## Example

For a pre-merge home node with 1/2 block proposals, >99% attestations and >99% sync participation:

- Independent Node Operation Multiplier = `1`
- Average Performance Multiplier = `(0.5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 0.83`
- Commitment Multiplier = `1.25`

```text
Final Multiplier = 1 * 0.83 * 1.25 = 1.03
```

[^1]: Performance is calculated as the average of all validators the member controls.
[^2]: Some validators may rotate keys for security reasons. Members can submit proof of ownership of historical keys for the purpose of calculating the multiplier.
